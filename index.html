        <h2>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</h2>
        <p>
          This is a beautiful book about resilience, grit and determination. The
          author has metaphorically used the lives of seagulls to depict human
          emotions in a very crude and enchanting manner. What stands out for
          me, is the seagull named Jonathan, who goes against his flocks'
          tendency to just eat, breed and survive. He dares to fly. He fails
          numerous times but ultimately flies and tastes freedom.
